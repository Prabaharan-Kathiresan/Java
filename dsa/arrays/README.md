#### Program1
    Find the pair which is sum equals to the given number. Two pointers technique used. 
#### Program2
    Remove duplicates from the array. Two pointer technique used. 
    Exercise: use the same technique to segregate 0's to the left & 1's the right
#### Program3
    Array Sorting. Approach1 - recursive strategy, Approach2 - Merge sorting. 
#### Program4
    Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
    We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
    You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.
#### Program5
    Find the Kth largest/smallest number in the array
#### Program6
    Matrix problems
#### Program7
    Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.
    Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

    Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
    Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
    Explanation: 
    nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
    nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
    nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
    The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
    Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.
